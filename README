Sorry for misunderstand the purpose of this assignement0, I thought all the thing I should upload is this txt. file.
Here is my finding in this assignment0.

I've implemented all lifecycle methods in this activity.

when I run this app, it called onCreate, onStart, onResume.

And then I rotate the phone, it called onPause, onStop, onDestroy, onCreate, onStart, onResume.
